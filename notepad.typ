- $T_0$: Vegetative priming
- $T_1$: Floral initiation
- $T_2$: Pollination
- $T_3$: Seed maturation (_Pinus_ only)


For 2 year reproductive cycles:

+ T0 occurs in early April; buds become dormant by November.
+ T1 occurs in early April; intial stages of sexual cone primordium formation, with differentiation
occuring through the spring of T1. These developing buds are sensitive to temperatures during
development, and environmental conditions have an effect on their developmental path through May and
June of T1. In unfavorable conditions, buds will abort. By mid-July of T1, vegetative and
reproductive buds are differentiated; by October, they are morphologically identifiable. By
December, buds have gone dormant.
+ Warm spring temperatures in T2 break dormancy and trigger pollen development. Fertilization and
embryonic development occurs from April through September. In autumn of T2, mature cones open and
shed seeds until late November.
