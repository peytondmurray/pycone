version 3.4, August 25, 2023

# NEW FEATURES
## Issues with previous versions
- dT the same for each date_range group
- offset did not work

## Fixes
1) Offset: the offset parameter was not implemented in the code. As a result, the same dT values were calculated for different offsets. Indexing was corrected; now the date_range label and offset is correct
2) Same dT: not sure why, but not the dT is different. I think it was probably because of the date_range group names? But I believe it resolved itself. Will see if Kelsey finds any issues!


# FILES
Modular R script
- readin_data.R
- function_calc_timestep_means.R
- function_dT.R
- function_r.R
- main.R


# HOW TO RUN

##SET UP//

OPEN FILE main.R
This is the code that you will run.

##First time: install packages at the top of script
install.packages("readxl")
install.packages("lubridate")

##Set Working Directory: set working directory to file location.
If you do not set the working directory, the script will not find
the input files.

##Read in data
source("readin_data.R")

##Calculate means
source("function_calc_timestep_means.R")
//end SET UP

##Set duration and offset

##Calculate dT
source("function_dT.R")

##Calculate r, r2
source("function_r.R")
- zero handling: add +0.5 to all cone values
- options to calculate r values according to version 2 and version 3:
   corr(exp(dT)/earlier_cone_val, cone_val)
   corr(exp(dT), cone_val)


TODO
*** create output folder with NAMES
* run code for all offsets in the timestep
* create loop to cycle through different timesteps
