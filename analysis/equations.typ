= Background

Traditionally cone crop prediction modeling has focused on calculating correlations
between various predictors and the annual cone count observed for a stand of trees.
Usually, predictor variables are functions of the average temperature in the years
preceeding the observed cone crop during the growing season, since that is when the
various biological processes involved in reproduction occur.

Kelly et al explored several such predictor variables and compared their correlations
across a broad dataset involving multiple plant families and over a long period of time.
The predictor variables considered were:

- $"T1"$ model: the mean summer temperature in the previous year ($T_(n-1)$).
- $"T2"$ model: the mean summer temperature 2 years previously ($T_(n-2)$).
- $Delta"T"$ model: the change in mean summer temperature over the two preceding years
  ($T_(n-1)â€“T_(n-2)$).
- $"2T"$ model: both mean summer temperature in the previous year ($T_(n-1)$) and mean
  summer temperature 2 years previously ($T_(n-2)$).

Correlations were calculated using linear fits between the predictor variable and $log$
of the annual seedfall $c$. Kelly et al compared the p-values calculated with the null
hypothesis being that no correlation exists, and found that for most plant families the
$Delta T$ model produced the lowest p-values, and concluded that $Delta T$ is an ideal
cue for seed crop prediction.

= Motivation


== Disadvantages of correlations

There are a number of reasons to suspect both alternative models and alternative
mathematical approaches could be better motivated than the proposed approach of Kelly et
al.

+ *p-values*: Although the p-values calculated are small, any analysis in which many
  p-values are calculated is bound to have statistically signficant p-values
  _somewhere_. No effort to control for the look-elsewhere effect was made. Furthermore
  the null hypothesis - that the models analyzed by Kelly have 0 correlation with seed
  crop - doesn't capture what is already known about plant reproduction; for example
  temperatures _must_ have an effect on reproductive processes because plants can't
  reproduce in temperatures inhospitable to life. It therefore isn't surprising that
  there's a correlation between some predictor involving temperature and the observed
  seed crop.

+ *Linearity*: There's no reason _a priori_ to think that the relationship between any
  of the predictors put forth by Kelly et al should be linear with $log(c)$, except that
  any continuous and differentiable function can be approximated to first order as a line
  (Taylor series). No discussion of this choice is made, even though it may be valid,
  although the implications of this assumption mean that the calculations become easier.

+ *Homoskedasticity and normality*: In the supplemental material, Kelly et al argue that
  empirically the measured seedfall appears to be homoskedastic, i.e. that the variance
  doesn't change with the number of seeds observed. This is part of a larger implied
  argument that the observed log-seedfall $log(c)$ is a normally distributed random
  variable with a fixed variance $sigma^2$ and a mean $Delta T$. In short,
  homoskedasticity is used as an argument that $log(c) tilde cal(N)(Delta T, sigma)$.

  But is seed production really a homoskedastic process? Naively plants that
  have more resources available for seed production should have a greater _variation_ in
  seed production. Furthermore the assumption of normality is not justified by the fact that
  the normal distribution has a nonzero probability on the support $(-infinity, infinity)$,
  while $log(c)$ is only defined (for real values) on the interval $(0, infinity)$, meaning
  that _any_ normally-distributed predictor can't possibly explain the range of seed
  crops observed in nature. Most importantly, log-transforming the seedfall is certainly
  unjustified for the simple fact that this approach cannot be used to correlate with
  years in which 0 seeds are observed ($log(0) = -infinity$). These data points are arguably
  the _most_ important observations in species that exhibit masting because in non-mast
  years, few to no seeds are often observed.

+ *Data Preprocessing*: As a result of the log-transformation that is carried out on the
  observed seedfall, years in which no seeds are observed cannot be used in the
  correlation without utterly dominating the linear fit used to produce the correlation
  ($log(0) = -infinity$). Kelly et al directly modify these observations before the log
  transformation, replacing them with values that are half the smallest nonzero value.
  Similar procedures are carried out elsewhere in the literature, but in all cases this
  approach is mathematically unjustified; any valid model of cone production must be able
  to predict 0-seedfall years.

+ *$Delta T$ as a model*: Intuition tells us that plants that experience freezing
  conditions for multiple years will not reproduce as much as the same plants that
  experience ideal growing conditions for multiple years because they simply do not have
  the same resources available for reproduction. However, two subsequent years of ideal
  reproductive temperatures may have the same small value of $Delta T$ as two subsequent
  years of terrible reproductive temperatures. Kelly et al discuss this as an
  interesting consequence of this model - that as a general rule plant reproduction will be
  insensitive to changes in global temperatures because $Delta T$ is unaffected by
  average changes in temperature. Furthermore the number of cones produced is not taken
  into account in the $Delta T$ model, although it is known that multiple sequential
  masting events are only rarely observed.

== A different approach

Instead of carrying out linear correlations, let's focus on a different approach.
Besides the reasons I've previously discussed for trying something different than Kelly
et al, there are also other reasons why one might want to take a Bayesian approach.
#link("https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2014/03/11/frequentism-and-bayesianism-a-practical-intro/")[Here's
a good discussion about this if you want to learn more.]

Here's the general idea:

+ We start by writing down a probability distribution which describes the probability of
  observing an individual data point $c_i$ given some model. I propose that the
  probability is given by a Poisson distribution:

  $
  P(c_i | c_(mu, i)) = frac(c_(mu, i)^(c_i) e^(-c_(mu, i)), c_i !)
  $<poisson>

  where $c_i$ is the number of cones observed for the stand on day $i$, and $c_(mu, i)$ is
  the Poisson rate parameter - the expected number of cones on day $i$.

  The Poisson distribution is a _counting distribution_, a distribution that gives the
  probability of a number of events happening in a given amount of time. It has some nice
  properties: it's discrete (i.e. it is only defined for integer cone counts) and is
  defined on the support $[0, infinity)$, as is required by our data.

+ From the probability of observing an individual day's cone crop $c_i$, we can write
  down the probability of observing the cone crop for all $N$ days (the entire dataset)
  by taking the product of all the individual probabilities:

  $
  P({c_i} | {c_(mu, i)}) = product_(i=0)^N frac(c_(mu, i)^(c_i) e^(-c_(mu, i)), c_i !)
  $

  This is the _likelihood_; in the literature it is usually written as

  $
  cal(L)(D | theta)
  $

  where for us the data $D = {c_i}$ and the model $theta = {c_(mu, i)}$.

+ From here, we can write down an expression for the _posterior_ probability
  distribution $cal(P)$, which is a distribution over our model parameters conditioned on
  our data. We make use of Bayes's theorem, and up to a normalization constant

  $
  cal(P)(theta | D) prop cal(L)(D | theta)P(theta)
  $

  where $P(theta)$ is a prior distribution; this distribution characterizes the
  epistemic uncertainty in our model _prior_ to observing any data.

In the Bayesian approach, getting the posterior probability distribution is the entire
goal. We could spend a long time talking about how this differs from frequentist
approaches which usually focus on metrics related to the likelihood (for example, least
squares fitting is equivalent to maximum likelihood estimation with the implicit and
extremely restrictive assumption that there is no uncertainty in the independent
variable, and normally distributed uncertainty in the observed dependent variable), but
for now I'm going to just point to
#link("https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2014/03/11/frequentism-and-bayesianism-a-practical-intro/")[Jake
VanderPlas's blog] and #link("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=911d4A1U0BE")[this talk
by Chris Fonnesbeck.]

As you'll see with models discussed below, usually the posterior can only be written
down in a nice closed form for certain special cases where the likelihood and priors are
_conjugate_. In that case you can actually calculate the posterior by hand, but in most
cases you really need to turn to computers to sample from the posterior distribution
numerically, and that's what we'll do here.

== Modeling

This part focuses on coming up with reasonable expressions of the rate parameter $c_(mu,
i)$. Fundamentally I think that the expected number of cones should be determined
entirely by what resources are available to produce them. For the discussion below, I
only attempted to fit data for site 1 (10ABAM_OR).

=== Three years preceeding model

This model assumes that the energy available to produce cones is mostly gathered from
average temperatures in specific windows in the three years preceeding the cone crop,
with no contribution from years before that. As a proxy for Photosynthetically Active
Radiation (PAR) we instead use temperature (since that's the data we have), and make the
assumption that the two are proportional. Under that assumption we can write down the
expected number of cones:

$
c_(mu, i) = c_0 + underbrace(alpha_0 angle.l T angle.r_(i - l_0, w_0) + alpha_1 angle.l T angle.r_(i - l_1, w_1) + alpha_2 angle.l T angle.r_(i - l_2, w_2), "PAR") - c_(i - l_3)
$

where $angle.l T angle.r_(i - l_k, w_k)$ denotes the moving average of the
temperature $T$ over a window of size $2w_k + 1$ days surrounding the day $i - l_k$.
Here, the $alpha_k$ are fit parameters which determine the relative importance of each
year's sunlight contribution to the stand's energy reserves. $c_0$ is the initial energy
reserves of the stand at the beginning of our observations, $c_(i-l_3)$ is the lagged
cone count from $l_3$ days in the past.

==== Priors

I chose some prior probability distributions based on what I know about cone production.
These characterize the epistemic uncertainty about our model parameters prior to
observing any data:

        columns: (auto, auto, auto, 1fr),

    ),
)

==== Posterior

I used Markov Chain Monte Carlo to sample from the posterior distribution using a
software package called #link("https://emcee.readthedocs.io/en/stable/")[`emcee`]. You
can think of this like a black box which proposes values of the model parameters $theta
= (c_0, alpha_0, alpha_1, alpha_2, w_0, w_1, w_2, l_0, l_1, l_2, l_3)$; I wrote code
that takes those proposed values and uses them to compute the prior and likelihood,
which are then multiplied to get a posterior probability, which I then pass back to the
black box. The `emcee` sampler then uses this posterior probability to generate new
proposed values of $theta$, and the process repeats many times. After an initial burn-in
period, if the probabilities are defined correctly and the sampler is able to
efficiently explore the parameter space, the sampler will eventually converge to certain
values of $theta$, and #link("https://msp.org/camcos/2010/5-1/p04.xhtml")[due to some
clever underlying math] we can guarantee that the samples being generated will
#link("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo")[match the posterior
distribution.]


#figure(
  image("mcmc_diagram.svg"),
  caption: [
    The MCMC sampler takes in an initial $theta$, and proposes new values of $theta$. For
    each proposal, we calculate the posterior probability of the proposed value, and pass
    it back to the sampler; it uses this value to generate new proposed values of
    $theta$. After some point, the new proposed values will converge to posterior
    probability distribution.
  ]
)

Looking at the values of $theta$ generated by the sampler, we can see they never really
settle to one specific value. There's probably an issue with the way I've parameterized
the problem.

#figure(
  image("typ_walkers_noreject_low_alpha.svg"),
  caption: [
    Markov chains for each fit parameter generated by `emcee`. Initially the chains vary
    as the MCMC sampler searches the parameter space of the problem; eventually they

    needs to be reparameterized.
  ]
)

#figure(
  image("typ_corner_noreject_low_alpha.svg"),
  caption: [
    Usually we discard the initial values produced by the sampler as it takes time for
    the Markov chains to converge to the posterior distribution. In this case the sampler
    never converged; even so, for illustrative purposes we can throw out the first 6000
    samples from each Markov chain, and then plot the histograms of the values of
    the model parameters. You can think of this plot as a series of 2D projections of
    the posterior probability which help us see how the model parameters depend on one
    another.
  ]
)

I tried a number of different transformations on the data but haven't found a stable
parameterization of this model yet. Part of the difficulty is due to the fact that some
of the variables here are meant to be discrete variables: the width of the moving
average windows and the lag period for each window must all be integers, whereas $alpha$
can be floating point. This introduces computational complexities that are not well
handled by some of the major Bayesian statistics packages. So to even get this model to
run I've had to compromise:

- I've needed to use `emcee`, a package with greater flexibility but quite slow
  sampling rate
- The sampler chooses floating point samples for _all_ parameters, but my model casts
  these to integers before computing the expected number of cones $c_(mu, i)$. This
  discretization means that numerically speaking the sampler isn't as effective
  at exploring the parameter space, as multiple floating point values of e.g. $w_0$ will
  be truncated to the same integer value:

  $
  angle.l T angle.r_(i - 20.2, 25.4) -> angle.l T angle.r_(i - 20, 25)\
  angle.l T angle.r_(i - 20.5, 25.7) -> angle.l T angle.r_(i - 20, 25)
  $

==== Posterior Predictive Distribution

Although the model is not well behaved, for illustrative purposes we can also pretend it
is, and discuss how we can use Bayesian models to make predictions. The way that this
is done in practice is again using a rigorous statistical treatment - we calculate the
*posterior predictive distribution*.
#link("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_predictive_distribution")[This is the
probability] of
#link("https://bayesiancomputationbook.com/markdown/chp_01.html?#equation-eq-post-pred-dist")[observing
some predicted dataset] _given_ the data we've already observed:

$
P(tilde(D) | D) = integral_theta P(tilde(D) | theta) P(theta | D) dif theta
$

In practice we do this by asking the computer to generate Poisson-distributed random
numbers (@poisson) using samples of the values of the model parameters $theta$. For each
sample of the model parameters, we generate a new dataset; here, I've generated 10000
such datasets:

#figure(
  image("typ_posterior_predictive_samples_noreject_low_alpha.svg"),
  caption: [
    10000 samples from the posterior predictive distribution, all plotted on the same
    graph. Each of these can be thought of as a prediction. The actual data is not close
    here because the sampler never converged.
  ]
)

Of course, these are just samples from the posterior predictive distribution; if we want
to get an idea of what the distribution itself looks like, we can histogram the cone
counts on each day across all predictions:

#figure(
  image("typ_posterior_predictive_histogram_noreject_low_alpha.svg"),
  caption: [
    10000 samples from the posterior predictive distribution histogrammed together. The
    actual data is not close to the distribution here because the sampler never
    converged.
  ]
)

For both figures above, the predictions start ~3 years into the dataset because that's
how much data we need to calculate a posterior probability; the model needs 3 years of
temperature data before it can start making predictions.

This is the kind of graph I'd eventually like to make once the bugs in the model/code
get sorted out. For now I've just included it to give you an idea of how I want to use
these tools, to give you time to think about this approach which is very different to
what has historically been done, and to hear your feedback.

=== Resource-Accumulation Model

Instead of looking at windows of time in some number of years preceeding a cone crop, we
could instead take into account all energy expenditure of the stand starting from the
beginning of the data.

$
c_(mu,i) =
    c_0
    + underbrace(alpha integral_0^t_i T(t) dif t, "PAR")
    - integral_0^t_i c(t) dif t
$

Here the resources accumulated by the tree over time are considered: the PAR received
each day is approximated as being proportional to the temperature that day; a
potentially dubious approximation. The available resources of the stand include all the
PAR absorbed since the beginning of the dataset less any spent on cone production.

#figure(
  image("ramodel_walkers_noreject_low_alpha.svg"),
  caption: [
    Markov chains for each fit parameter generated by `emcee` for the RAModel. The
    walkers never seem to explore the parameter space.
  ]
)

#figure(
  image("ramodel_corner_noreject_low_alpha.svg"),
  caption: [
    The posterior probability distribution sampled by `emcee` for the RAModel. The
    sampler never explores the parameter space; additional debugging is required.
  ]
)

I haven't bothered computing the posterior predictive distribution because I clearly
can't sample effectively with the way I've written this model. So I've got to debug this
before moving on to posterior predictive checks.

== Discussion

It took a number of months to realize that we don't need to entertain models that are
similiar to $Delta T$ if we don't want to, although that's what we had initially. We
have the freedom to explore whatever model makes sense to us. Right now something like
the resource-accumulation model makes the most sense to me, in part because it actually
fully accounts for the energy flowing into the tree as PAR and flowing out of the tree
from cone production, and partly because it is simpler than the n-years preceeding
model. There are fewer free parameters and computationally it's easier to model. This
means I don't need to stick to `emcee`, I can switch to the much faster `pymc`, which
may allow more models and parametrizations to be explored.

=== A clue about where to go next

Some samples produced by the sampler result in a PAR term which is smaller than the cone
contribution term for certain days; this is particularly true in the immediate aftermath
of masting events, in which the cone-contribution term overwhelms the PAR term. This of
course results in a negative expected cone crop rate parameter, which doesn't make
physical sense. Moreover this results in nan-valued probabilities after masting events,
which makes posterior predictive checks impossible in these regions. Up to this point
I've been dealing with this by essentially omitting their contribution to the posterior
probability.

One alternative is to set the probability for these data points to 0, which should push
the sampler to higher values of $alpha$ to compensate. So far I've had absolutely no
luck with this - it just seems like the Markov chains don't vary when I do this. Sorry I
don't have more interesting news yet, but I'm still debugging, reparameterizing, and
thinking about this.

Finally, the observed model instabilities could be due to
- Poor parameterization. The sampler most effectively explores parameter space when the
  steps it needs to take are roughly equal for each model parameter.
- A bug
- Poor initial guesses for the values of the parameters
- Some other problem with the model. I've tried to strike a balance so that the models I
  was running were not overly complex, but it's possible I need to include a term for the
  energy spent by the stand on things that _aren't_ reproducing, e.g. growing wood,
  respirating, etc. I don't see this as an intrinsic reason why this approach won't
  work, I just haven't yet explored it.
- Unjustified priors. One of the things I like about the Bayesian approach is that all
  the assumptions are explicit. There are almost certainly better choices to be made for
  the priors here, so it's possible that could really affect the sampling.
